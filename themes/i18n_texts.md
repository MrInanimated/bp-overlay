These bits of text are drawn on the canvas and so will dynamically update.

Static
------

These bits of text are (usually) used in the chat, and as such are static and once they are set they cannot change. However, new text from these after a theme has loaded will then use the theme-defined messages.

| `nuclearnode:userRoles.`                         | key 'nuclearnode:userRoles. (en)' returned an object instead of string. *(This error message shows up when somebody loses their role. Apparently Élisée didn't foresee the fact that people could be unmodded despite implementing it in the game. Anyway, you can assume this should say "no longer a mod" or something similar.)* |
