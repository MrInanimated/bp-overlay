If you have firefox, you will require Greasemonkey, which you can find <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">here</a>.

If/once you have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey installed, you can use this link to install the overlay:

<a href="https://github.com/MrInanimated/bp-overlay/raw/master/dist/bpoverlay.min.user.js">Bombparty Overlay</a>

Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey should automatically pick it up as a userscript, and allow you to install it.
